      # Hello world!

      **Everything** supported in a `.md` file is also supported here!

      There is _zero_ runtime overhead.

      In addition, Astro supports:
      - Astro expressions
      - Automatic indentation normalization
      - Automatic escaping of expressions inside code blocks

      ```js
        // This content is not transformed!
        const object =  someOtherValue ;
      ```

      - Rich component support like any `.astro` file!
      - Recursive Markdown support (Component children are also processed as Markdown)

  </Markdown>
